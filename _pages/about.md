## What is a Static Site?
![Unsplash image 10]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jekyll-logo.png)

A static website contains Web pages with fixed content. That means, each page displays the same information to every visitor.

Since static Web pages contain fixed code,the content of each page does not change unless it is manually updated by the webmaster. This works well for small websites, but it can make large sites with hundreds or thousands of pages difficult to maintain. Therefore, larger websites typically use dynamic pages, which can be updated by simply modifying a database record. Static sites that contain a lot of pages are often designed using templates. This makes it possible to update several pages at once, and also helps provide a consistent layout throughout the site.

### Advantages of a static website

- Provide improved security over dynamic websites (dynamic websites are at risk to web shell attacks if a vulnerability is present).
- Improved performance for end users compared to dynamic websites
- Fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers.
- Cost savings from utilizing cloud storage, as opposed to a hosted environment.

### Disadvantages of a static website
- Dynamic functionality must be performed on the client side.
