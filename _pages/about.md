I Completed my higher education at University of Moratuwa, SriLanka and graduated as a professional in Electronic and Telecommunictaion field. Throughout these years, I worked on many projects related to different tech fileds and I was so keen to share this experience with the vast community with the pure passion. However, I made sure to build this site with some fun and cool entertainment items because, it won't be sooo boring, going through a bunch of tech text paragraphs.

## What is a Static Site?

A static website contains Web pages with fixed content. That means, each page displays the same information to every visitor.

Since static Web pages contain fixed code,the content of each page does not change unless it is manually updated by the webmaster. This works well for small websites, but it can make large sites with hundreds or thousands of pages difficult to maintain. Therefore, larger websites typically use dynamic pages, which can be updated by simply modifying a database record. Static sites that contain a lot of pages are often designed using templates. This makes it possible to update several pages at once, and also helps provide a consistent layout throughout the site.

### Advantages of a static website

- Provide improved security over dynamic websites (dynamic websites are at risk to web shell attacks if a vulnerability is present).
- Improved performance for end users compared to dynamic websites
- Fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers.
- Cost savings from utilizing cloud storage, as opposed to a hosted environment.

## What  is Jekyll?
