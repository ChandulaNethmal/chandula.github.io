Vehicles with self-driving function are being increased day by day with introducing new facilities which can assure more safety and comfort for the consumers. Because of the introduction to the public of these cars was happened in the near past, they are being still tested for find their feasibility on the road. Although the most of official results of the tests are not released, there are many videos taken by in-car dash cams or mobile phones are available in the social media. Somehow they help us to reveal those autonomous vehicles’ behavior through their failures.

As the results most of the problems which are occurred with the autonomous vehicles are happened due to the lack of the ability to understand other drivers’ actions. These failures are made by some humans by their own selfish and unpredictable behavior on the road.
Since a human driver’s predicting procedure about other drivers is very similar to themselves’ most of the times human drivers can understand same kind of drivers’ behavior.

Although the autonomous vehicles can be safe and always in tune with others, they are failed on recognizing the social environment of the road because they are algorithmic agents. In some case like maintaining certain gap between two cars, autonomous vehicles keep that distance with good accuracy as it safe. But human drives lose the safe by wrongly guessing this as an offer to overtake and entering there.

Development of the ability to predicate the road situations is important rather than enhancing the comfort of these cars. So manufacturers must study these kind problems and develop them to act more precisely on the real social environment when they programming these vehicles.
